                    <h3>What is Crypto Currency ?</h3>
                    <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that employs cryptography for security purposes, 
                        making it difficult to counterfeit or double-spend. It is decentralized in nature, 
                        operating on a technology called blockchain, 
                        which is a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers or nodes. </p>  <br><b>
                        
                        <p>
                            Cryptocurrencies are typically not issued or regulated by any central authority, making them immune to government manipulation or interference. They offer a new paradigm for financial systems, enabling secure, peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or other financial institutions. The history of the word “cryptocurrency” can be traced back to the early 21st century, when the concept of digital currencies secured by cryptography started gaining traction. The term is a portmanteau of “cryptography” and “currency.” Cryptography, the practice of secure communication techniques, dates back to ancient civilizations, but its application in digital currencies is a relatively recent development.
